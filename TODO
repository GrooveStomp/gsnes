- Screen isn't rendering.

- Fuzzy font rendering.
  Font overdraw? Improper buffer clearing?

- Double-rendering for text.
  For invalid disassembly lines draw a red line and see red show through other spots where text is rendered.
  This may be the same bug as the fuzzy font rendering.

- Rendering CPU state includes garbage after valid string.
  I think the string capacity is specified incorrectly and/or there is a missing null character.
  Look in cpu.c in the debug/disassembly stuff.
